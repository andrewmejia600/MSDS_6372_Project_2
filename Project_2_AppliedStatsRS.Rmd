This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

##tally is a convenient wrapper for summarise that will either call n or sum(n) depending on whether you're tallying for the first time, or #re-tallying. count() is similar, but also does the group_by for you.
bank_addl %>% group_by(pdays) %>% tally() %>% arrange(desc(n)) %>% head()



# Find Correlation between prevous and pdays
cor(bank_addl$previous, bank_addl$pdays)  ## Note these are correlated. we may drop pdays


# correlaion between previous and response y. There is relation here.
ggplot(bank_addl %>% group_by(previous, y) %>%  tally(), 
       aes(previous, n, fill = y)) +
      geom_col() +
